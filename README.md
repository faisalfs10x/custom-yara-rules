# custom-yara-rules
custom auto-generated yara rules/signatures based on MITRE ATT&CK for self-study research

### Rules:

- [Hacktool_PUA_Chisel_TCP_Tunneling ](https://github.com/faisalfs10x/custom-yara-rules/blob/0b8c1fe4a1a404a5f27479576008fbfcb8da24ba/C&C/Protocol%20Tunneling/Hacktool_PUA_Chisel_TCP_Tunneling.yar) - I create this rule to be used in THOR scanner lite version as the Chisel binary is not being detected during previous security incident.
